# Deep Learning from Scratch 1
This repository contains my hands-on implementations and learning notes based on the book  
**"Deep Learning from Scratch"** by Yasuki Saito.

The goal of this project is to gain a fundamental understanding of how neural networks work  
by implementing core deep learning algorithms **from scratch using only NumPy**,  
without relying on any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
